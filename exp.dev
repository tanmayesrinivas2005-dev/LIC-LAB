# Theory

## PMOS Common Source Amplifier

In a PMOS CS amplifier:

- Input is applied to the gate  
- Output is taken from the drain  
- Source is connected to $( V_{DD} $)

The output is 180° out of phase with the input.

---

## Conditions for Proper Operation

For correct amplification, the MOSFET must operate in the **saturation region**.

The required conditions are:

1. $V_{SG} \geq V_{th}$  
   → To turn the transistor ON  

2. $V_{SD} > V_{SG} - V_{th}$  
   → To keep the transistor in saturation  

3. The input signal $v_{in}$ must be small  
   → To ensure small-signal operation  

4. Proper biasing and correct selection of $R_D$  
   → To obtain stable operation and sufficient voltage gain  

---

## Drain Current Equation

In saturation region:

$$
I_D = \frac{1}{2} k_p (V_{SG} - |V_{th}|)^2
$$

---

## Small Signal Gain

$$
A_v = -g_m R_D
$$

$$
g_m = \frac{2I_D}{V_{ov}}
$$

Negative sign indicates phase inversion.

# DESIGN CALCULATIONS

For maximum symmetrical swing:

$V_{out}$ = $V_{DD}$ / 2  
$V_{out}$ = 2 / 2 = 1V  

Power constraint:

P = $V_{DD}$× $I_D$  
1.5mW ≥ 1.5 × $I_D$  
$I_D$ ≤ 0.75mA  

##  Selection of Drain Current and Saturation Verification

To satisfy the power constraint (P ≤ 1.5 mW), the drain current must be limited.
Maximum allowable current:
$I_D$ ≤ 0.75 mA
Chosen design value:
$I_D$ = 500 µA

---

### Threshold Voltage

From the TSMC 0.18 µm model parameters:
$V_{th}$ = 0.39 V (from datasheet)

---

### Saturation Condition

For an PMOS transistor to operate in saturation:

$V_{SD}$ ≥ $V_{SG}$ − $V_{th}$
Rearranging:

$V_{SG}$ ≤ $V_{SD}$ + $V_{th}$

In this design:
$V_{SD}$ = Vout = 1 V

Substituting:
Assume  $V_{ov}$ =0.2V


$V_{ov}$ = $V_{SG}$ - $V_{th}$


$V_{SG}$≤ 1.409 V

The transistor operates in the saturation region.

### Conclusion

The selected drain current and gate bias ensure proper saturation operation, making the circuit suitable for linear amplification.

---

Drain resistor:

$$
R_D = \frac{V_{out}}{I_D}
$$

$$
R_D = \frac{1V}{0.5mA}
$$

$$
R_D = 2k
$$


##  Calculation of Process Parameter of (kn) and Transistor Width

The process transconductance parameter is given by:

kn = μn Cox

Where:

μn = 115.689 × 10⁻⁴  
εox = 3.45 × 10⁻¹¹  
tox = 4.1 × 10⁻⁹  

Since:

Cox = εox / tox

Cox = (3.45 × 10⁻¹¹) / (4.1 × 10⁻⁹)

Therefore,

kn = 0.973 × 10⁻⁴ A/V²

---

### Width Calculation

Using the MOSFET saturation current equation:

$I_D = \frac{1}{2} k_p (V_{ov})^2$
(neglecting  channel length modulation)

Substituting:

$I_D$  = 500 × 10⁻⁶ A  
L = 560 nm  
$V_{SG}$ = 0.9 V  
$V_{th}$ = 0.39 V  


Rearranging to find W:

W = [2 × $I_D$ × L] / [kn × ( $V_{ov}$)²]

W = (2 × 500 × 10⁻⁶ × 560 × 10⁻⁹) / (0.973× 10⁻⁴ × (0.2)²)

After calculation:

W = 144 µm

---

The calculated transistor width required to obtain ID = 500 µA is:

W = 333.5 µm

## Practical Width Adjustment in LTspice

From theoretical calculations:

W = 144 µm  
for $I_D$ = 500 µA

However, when simulated in LTspice using:

W =333.5 µm

The obtained drain current was:

$I_D$ ≈ 500.0043µA




## DC analysis is performed to determine the biasing condition (operating point) of the MOSFET.

It calculates the steady-state values of $I_D$, $V_{SG}$, and $V_{SD}$ to ensure the transistor operates in the **saturation region** for proper and distortion-free amplification.

# DC Sweep Analysis – PMOS CS Amplifier


In a PMOS Common Source amplifier, the **gate voltage $(V_G$) controls the **source-to-gate voltage $(V_{SG}$) and hence the drain current $(I_D$).  


By sweeping \(V_G\) from 0 to \(V_{DD}\), we can plot $(V_{out}$) vs $(V_G$) to find the **DC bias point**.  


The bias is chosen so that the drain voltage is approximately half of $(V_{DD}$) for maximum output swing, keeping the transistor in **saturation**.

# Transient Analysis of Common Source (CS) Amplifier

## Introduction

Transient analysis is performed to study the time-domain behavior of the Common Source (CS) amplifier. It shows how the output voltage changes with respect to time when an input signal is applied.

## Purpose of Transient Analysis

The main objectives are:

- To observe signal amplification over time
- To verify phase inversion (180° phase shift)
- To measure voltage gain from input and output waveforms
- To check signal distortion and stability




## Voltage Gain Measurement

Voltage gain is calculated using peak values:

$$
A_v = \frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}
$$

Since the CS amplifier inverts the signal:

$$
A_v = - \frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}

## 1. Theoritical calculation for gain

$$
A_v = -g_m R_D
$$

where $g_m$=transconductance

  $R_d$ =Resistor

  $$
g_m = \frac{2 I_D}{V_{ov}}
$$

 $$
g_m = \frac{2.0.5mA}{0.2V}
$$

  $$
  g_m=0.005
  $$

  $$
A_v = -g_m R_D
$$

$$
A_v = -0.005*2000
$$

$$
A_v = -10
$$

---

## Peak-to-Peak Calculation

$$
V_{pp} = V_{max} - V_{min}
$$

$$
V_{pp} = 1.1081 - 898.7544
$$

$$
V_{pp} \approx 209.372\,mV
$$
<p align="center">
  <img width="1359" height="591" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d166d104-0a46-4f51-b660-b8854f8ea1eb" />

## Voltage Gain Calculation

Input peak-to-peak voltage:

$$
V_{in(pp)} = 1.4188 - 1.399
$$

$$
V_{in(pp)} = 19.669\,mV
$$

Output peak-to-peak voltage:

$$
V_{out(pp)} = 209.37\,mV
$$

Voltage gain:

$$
A_v = \frac{V_{out(pp)}}{V_{in(pp)}}
$$

$$
A_v = \frac{209.372}{19.66}
$$

$$
A_v \approx 10.64
$$

Since the Common Source amplifier produces phase inversion:

$$
A_v \approx -10.64
$$

### Reason for Negative Gain

The gain of a PMOS Common Source amplifier is negative because it produces phase inversion.
When the input voltage increases (gate voltage rises toward $(V_{DD})$, the source-to-gate voltage $(V_{SG})$ decreases.
This reduces the drain current $(I_D)$, causing a smaller voltage drop across $(R_D)$.
As a result, the output voltage increases, making the output 180° out of phase with the input.

## AC Analysis
<img width="1356" height="601" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90c91d92-9868-4f3d-a196-3109f2accdc7" />



AC analysis is used to determine the frequency response of the amplifier.
To get the proper bandwidth we need to add a capacitor of 1FF because

$$
A_{vdB}= 20log(A_v)
$$


$$
A_{vdB}= 20log(10.64)
$$


$$
A_{vdB}= 20.538
$$




### Midband Gain
<img width="1350" height="620" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eac91870-9be0-42a1-86f8-18dde6351660" />



### Half-Power (-3 dB) Frequency

$$
20.538 - 3 = 17.538
$$

From the graph, gain reaches 17.538 dB at approximately:

$$
f_H \approx 453.54MHz
$$

### Bandwidth

Since no low-frequency cutoff is observed:

$$
BW = f_H
$$

$$
BW \approx 453.54MHz
$$

## With load Capacitor (CL = 1pF)

<img width="1358" height="598" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23640d47-d13a-4a06-8d4a-437adbcaf11c" />


Midband Gain ≈20.538 dB  
 

# GAIN BANDWIDTH PRODUCT (GBP)

with capacitor

GBP = Av × BW  

GBP = 10.64 × 473.54 MHz  

GBP ≈ 4852.6656 MHz  

 
From simulation:
- GBP ≈ 109 MHz  
  

Ideally, for a single dominant-pole system, the gain-bandwidth product (GBP) should equal the unity gain frequency. However, in a practical PMOS CS amplifier, a slight difference is observed.

This difference arises because the amplifier is not an ideal single-pole system. The parasitic capacitances (Cgs, Cgd, Cdb) in the PMOS device, combined with the Miller effect, finite output resistance (ro), and other short-channel effects in 0.18 µm technology, introduce additional high-frequency poles.

As a result, the frequency response deviates slightly from the ideal single-pole behavior, causing the unity gain frequency to be slightly lower than the calculated GBP.

This variation is small and is expected in practical CMOS PMOS amplifier designs, particularly when operating at high frequencies or in scaled technologies.

# Inference
The Common Source PMOS amplifier was successfully designed and analyzed using TSMC 180 nm technology under the given power constraint. The transistor was properly biased in the saturation region with a drain current of 500 µA and power dissipation of 1 mW. The simulated voltage gain was 10 V/V (20.538dB), which is close to the theoretical value. The bandwidth with 1 pF load capacitance was found to be 473.54 MHz. The results validate proper amplifier operation considering practical non-ideal effects.
